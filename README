# fake_news detection model
This is my fake news detection repository...

In this model we use Machine Learning to predict whether a news is Fake or True.
In this model we use 4 types of algorithms-
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classification
3. Gradient Boosting Classifier
4. Random Forest Classifier

And lastly, we have to give input a news and the model will predict whether its True or Fake.
